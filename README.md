## About :
I have created an application that is designed to assist patients at a dental clinic. The application allows users to register as a client by providing their personal information. Once registered, users can log in and access their profile, which displays their personal information and upcoming appointments. The application allows patients to make an appointment by selecting the date, time, and dentist of their choice. The profile view also allows patients to delete appointments they have scheduled themselves. 
This feature provides patients with the flexibility to manage their appointments without having to contact the clinic. 
Overall, the application is designed to make it easy for patients to schedule and manage their dental appointments, providing convenience and a better user experience.
